# Cerase Tasks MCP — the agent's Projects & Tasks board (PROJ-3).
#
# A thin first-party proxy to the control-plane PROJ-2 internal
# endpoints (no work of its own). Exposes 4 tools: create_task,
# set_status, list_tasks, create_project. FastMCP stdio bridged by
# mcp-proxy — same shape as the other cerase-* MCP images.
